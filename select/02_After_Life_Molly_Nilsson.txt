I went out to walk and feed the night
What i chase is always out of sight
Surely i've been misbehaving
I'm deserving everything that's awaiting
The story goes on...

I kept going, must have gone too far
Sometimes we don't even know where we are
Looking at the cars and stealing all the stars
I walked right into a bar, where
They kept the radio on
The song they play makes you wanna sing along
We go along, we know there's nothing wrong
We try to live in the along, knowing it goes on
Long after we're gone
After we're gone

We know it's never too late
We know the end awaits
Life will bring about this fear of missing out
There's a party going on and our lives
Are open all night long

And the story goes on
And we're just people who are trying to get along
Thank you for having me and here in my song,
We know there's nothing wrong
With knowing that the music goes on
After we're gone
After we're gone
